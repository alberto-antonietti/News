**h 11:30 - 12:30**

**Politecnico di Milano - DEIB Conference room - Building 20**

## An introduction to Bayesian data analysis with PyStan

### Abstract

This seminar is intended to be a small contribution to the statistical literacy in the scientific field. In fact, empirical research relays on statistical methods. An introduction to the Bayesian inference is given, in a way that every scientist or engineer can follow. The possibility to quantify the uncertainty and to better interpret the results are advantages of the Bayesian approach. A practical demonstration will be given on how to perform a statistical modelling and to make predictions, in particular with an example in cognitive science, with the aim of evaluating learning performances. In order to do this, PyStan will be exploited. PyStan is the Python interface to Stan, the leading open-source software for Bayesian inference.
