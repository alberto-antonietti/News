# Seminar on Applied Bayesian Statistics by Marianne Corvellec, PhD

**22 October 2018**

**11:30 - 12:30**

**Politecnico di Milano - DEIB Conference room - Building 20**

## Another introduction to Bayesian data analysis with PyStan

### Abstract

This seminar is meant as a small contribution to improve statistical literacy in the scientific context. Indeed, empirical research relies on statistical methods. We start with a brief introduction to Bayesian inference, making sure it is accessible to scientists and engineers of all backgrounds (using plain language and explanatory diagrams). The benefits of the Bayesian approach include uncertainty quantification (for all model parameters and predictions) and the ability to interpret results. We give a practical demonstration of how to build a statistical model and compute predictions, going through a cognitive science example (more specifically in learning assessment). To do this, we use PyStan, the Python interface to Stan. Stan is the state-of-the-art, free and open-source engine for Bayesian inference.
